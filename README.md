Jitescript - Java API for Bytecode
==================================

This project is inspired by [BiteScript](https://github.com/headius/bitescript). The goal is to produce a Java library with a similar API
so that bytescript generation can be as nice in Java as BiteScript makes it in JRuby.


Build Instructions
====================
* [Install Gradle 1.x](http://gradle.org/downloads.html)
* Run `gradle jar`
* Take the resulting jar at `./build/libs/jitescript-*.jar`.
